                <h3>Day 1 – Exploring the City</h3>
                <p>Our journey to Porto began in the middle of the afternoon as we boarded a flight to Portugal, filled with excitement and curiosity about the week ahead. After landing, we took a bus through the outskirts of the city, catching our first glimpses of the local scenery — colorful buildings, winding streets, and vibrant life. Despite the travel fatigue, anticipation kept our spirits high.</p>
                <p>We arrived at the hotel around 7 PM and had just enough time to settle into our rooms, freshen up, and regroup. Once we were ready, we headed out to explore the historic city center. Walking through the lively streets of Porto, we discovered charming alleys, old architecture, and vibrant city life. The evening ended with our first taste of Portuguese cuisine at a local restaurant — a perfect way to begin this cultural and educational adventure. It was a long day, but the excitement of being in a new country made every moment feel worth it.</p>

                <h3>Day 2 – Cultural discovery and Agile methodology</h3>
                <p>The day began with a class focused on the Portuguese language and local customs. It was both informative and enjoyable, as we learned useful phrases and explored some of the cultural nuances that shape daily life in Portugal. The session helped us feel more connected to our surroundings and more confident interacting with locals during our stay. We also had the chance to discuss key traditions and historical influences, giving us a broader understanding of Portuguese identity.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we shifted gears for a more technical session on Agile methodology — a modern and collaborative approach to project management widely used in the IT industry. Through concrete examples and practical explanations, we gained insight into how Agile teams work, communicate, and adapt quickly to change. It was a valuable introduction that linked well with our studies in computer science and gave us a new perspective on teamwork and productivity.</p>
                <p>After classes, we took some time to enjoy the sunny weather and explore Porto on foot. Our walk through the city led us to new streets, scenic viewpoints, and small local shops. We’re beginning to get a feel for the rhythm of the city, and each outing helps us discover something new — whether it’s a hidden courtyard, a stunning tiled façade, or the relaxed pace of life that gives Porto its charm.</p>

                <h3>Day 3 – From HTML to holograms</h3>
                <p>This morning, we had an introductory course on web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though some of us were already familiar with the basics, it was a great opportunity to refresh our knowledge and solidify our understanding of how websites are built. The session covered everything from structuring content with HTML to styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript. It was both practical and motivating — a reminder of how powerful even the simplest lines of code can be.</p>
                <p>After a quick lunch break, we switched gears from creating digital content to experiencing it, with a visit to the Néonia museum here in Porto. The museum offered an immersive journey through the intersection of technology, light, and contemporary art. We explored interactive installations, digital projections, and soundscapes that challenged our perception and sparked a lot of conversation among the group. It was inspiring to see how tech can be used not just for function, but for emotion, expression, and storytelling.</p>
                <p>We ended the day with a walk back through the city, still discussing some of our favorite exhibits and how they tied in (however loosely) with what we’d learned in the morning. Moments like these help us appreciate both the technical and creative sides of our field — and Porto is proving to be the perfect place to explore both.</p>
                <p>In today’s photo, you can see our awesome squad: Maxence, Romain, Alexandre and me (from right to left). Future web developers… or maybe fashion models — we’re still deciding!</p>

                <h3>Day 4 – Python in the morning, market stroll by the river in the afternoon</h3>
                <p>We started the day with a programming session focused on Python — one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today. Whether it was a first introduction or a refresher for some of us, we explored key concepts like variables, loops, conditions, and functions. The examples were clear and approachable, and the relaxed atmosphere encouraged questions, support, and collaboration — a great opportunity to learn together.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we took advantage of the sunny weather to go for a walk along the Douro River. Along the way, we visited a riverside market filled with handmade crafts, souvenirs, and local specialties. The lively ambiance, with music, inviting smells, and friendly vendors, made it a memorable experience. Surrounded by colorful facades and a view of the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge, we took in the charm of Porto from a whole new angle.</p>
                <p>Discovering a place like this after a morning of coding gave us a refreshing shift in pace, while still deepening our connection to the local culture. A well-balanced day, blending learning and exploration in the best possible way.</p>

                <p>We started the day with a visit to a beautiful park, where we took our time exploring, relaxing, and enjoying lunch surrounded by nature. One of the highlights? Spotting peacocks and roosters roaming freely through the gardens — an unexpected but charming surprise.</p>
                <p>The park itself was stunning, filled with a wide variety of flowers and offering breathtaking views at every turn. The calm atmosphere and vibrant colors made it a perfect morning escape from the usual rhythm of the city.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we headed to the beach to cool off. The moment we hit the sand, the mood shifted: laughter, splashes, and general chaos took over. Between swimming, joking around, and enjoying the sun, we definitely let our inner kids run free.</p>
                <p>By the time we returned to the hotel, we were tired but happy — and just a little sunburned. A perfect mix of nature, fun, and sea air to recharge before the next day.</p>

                <h3>Day 6 – Aveiro: canals, sunshine, and celebrations</h3>
                <p>For our sixth day, we left Porto to explore Aveiro, a city located about an hour to the south. Nicknamed the Portuguese Venice, Aveiro immediately charmed us with its canals running through the town, colorful gondolas, blooming facades, and cheerful atmosphere, all accompanied by lively street music and friendly locals.</p>
                <p>One of the highlights of the day was discovering an open-air shopping village made up of charming little lanes lined with vibrant storefronts. The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, perfect for strolling, browsing the shops, and soaking in the sun with music playing in the background.</p>
                <p>We also enjoyed a walk through a beautiful park where some of the architectural elements echoed classical Roman design. This green and elegant setting offered a refreshing, peaceful break in the middle of the day.</p>
                <p>In the evening, we had dinner at a local restaurant and got the chance to taste a regional specialty: vinho verde, or green wine. As we ate, the sun began to set, casting a golden light over the terrace and wrapping the moment in a gentle summer-like warmth. It felt like the perfect end to a long, sunny day.</p>
                <p>On our way out, we stumbled upon locals celebrating the results of the national elections. With honking horns, cheering voices, and waving flags, the streets came alive with joy and excitement. It was a lively way to wrap up the day before catching the train back to our hotel, heads full of memories.</p>

                <h3>Day 7 – Roaring engines and a ride through Braga</h3>
                <p>On our seventh day, we were up bright and early to attend a stage of the famous Rally of Portugal, part of the World Rally Championship. We went to see the Paredes special stage, and the atmosphere was absolutely electric. The cars sped by at incredible speeds, drifting through corners and kicking up huge clouds of dust with every turn. It was loud, chaotic… and completely breathtaking. Watching these drivers push the limits of control and precision in such extreme conditions was truly unforgettable.</p>
                <p>In the evening, we switched gears and headed to Braga, a charming city north of Porto often referred to as the "Portuguese Rome" due to its abundance of churches and rich religious heritage. Johan and I explored it on electric scooters — a fun and efficient way to see the town’s iconic landmarks. From historic monuments to lively squares lit up at night, the city had a magical vibe that made the ride feel almost cinematic.</p>
                <p>One especially memorable moment: while riding up to the Miradouro do Monte do Picoto to enjoy the panoramic view, the rear wheel of Johan’s scooter locked up. He had to push it all the way uphill by hand. Hilarious for us… a bit less for him!</p>
                <p>A day packed with adrenaline in the morning and relaxed adventure in the evening—just the kind of balance that makes this trip so special.</p>

                <h3>Day 8 – From Artificial Intelligence to Atlantic Waves</h3>
                <p>The morning began with a fascinating class on artificial intelligence, where we focused in particular on ChatGPT. It was a great opportunity to better understand how these technologies work and the role they’re playing more and more in our daily lives—and in our future careers.</p>
                <p>After class, we headed to Lidl to grab something to eat. That’s when things got unexpectedly funny: Romain and Alexandre couldn’t figure out how to scan their receipt to open the exit gate. A brief moment of confusion (or clumsiness) that had us all laughing. Let’s just say they didn’t escape the teasing.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we took the train to Espinho to visit the town’s large open market, which stays open until 7 PM. We wandered through the stands, picked up some snacks, and enjoyed the local vibe.</p>
                <p>We wrapped up the day at the beach, facing the Atlantic Ocean. The sky was clear, the air was warm, and the waves crashing against the rocks created a soothing soundtrack. We took lots of photos and took the time to simply enjoy the peaceful moment. A beautiful contrast between high-tech learning and the calm of nature to end the day.</p>

                <h3>Day 9 – Networks, laughter, and clippers</h3>
                <p>This ninth day will surely be one to remember… because it was Quentin’s birthday! To celebrate, we decided to start the day with a little surprise: we took him to a hair salon. But not for a stylish haircut. No, the goal was clear — to give him a deliberately awful haircut that he would have to wear all day. The hairdresser, both laughing and feeling a bit sorry for him, still carried out the mission with impressive dedication. The result? A hair disaster worthy of the boldest fashion mishaps.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we got back to more serious matters with a networking class focused on using the Cisco application and creating network diagrams. It was a hands-on and useful session, helping us get familiar with a key area in our studies.</p>
                <p>After class, we took some time to continue exploring the city, visiting a few spots we hadn’t seen yet.</p>
                <p>When evening came, the vibe shifted toward celebration. We spent time laughing and having fun while waiting for midnight. And once the clock struck twelve, it was time for the grand finale: armed with a hair clipper, we shaved off the last surviving strands of Quentin’s haircut, in a delightfully ridiculous moment. After a few funny photo edits and a couple of kisses on his freshly shaved head, we wrapped up this one-of-a-kind day in style.</p>

                <h3>Day 10 – Operating systems and sunset views</h3>
                <p>We started the day with a class focused on operating systems. It was a dense but essential topic that helped us better understand the foundations behind everything that keeps our computers running.</p>
                <p>As we left the classroom, we stumbled upon a nice surprise right in front of El Corte Inglés shopping center — a stunning red Ferrari parked at the entrance. Naturally, we stopped to admire it for a while! The shopping center itself was impressive, with ten floors of stores, restaurants, and services. We took a quick walk around and were amazed by its size.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we switched gears and took the Gaia cable car, which offered us a breathtaking view over the city of Porto and the Douro River, bathed in sunlight. It was a peaceful moment, floating above the rooftops and soaking in the beauty of the landscape.</p>
                <p>To end the day, we headed to the beach. We laughed a lot, walked along the shore, and enjoyed the late afternoon waiting for the sunset to paint the horizon behind the waves. The sound of the ocean, the golden light, and the calm atmosphere made for the perfect ending to a full and memorable day.</p>

                <p>We woke up early for a new adventure: departure at 8 AM for Coimbra, a city located about two hours south of Porto by train. Once we arrived, we began our visit at the Igreja de São João das Donas, also known as São João de Santa Cruz. Its impressive architecture, the organ mounted on the wall, and the peaceful cloister and sanctuary immediately immersed us in a place full of history and grandeur.</p>
                <p>We then made our way up the narrow streets to reach the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, nestled at the top of the city’s hill. The climb was quite a workout, and by the time we reached the summit, our stomachs were loudly reminding us it was time for lunch. We settled into a restaurant with a stunning view, overlooking the city’s rooftops and lively streets.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, we slowed the pace and visited the New Cathedral of Coimbra, followed by a walk through one of the city’s greatest treasures: its prestigious university, one of the oldest in Europe. With its historical buildings and academic atmosphere, the place had a unique and inspiring character.</p>
                <p>To end the day, we relaxed in a shady park nearby, enjoying a peaceful break while waiting for our return train to Porto. Back in the city, we found a quiet spot to watch the sunset behind the bridge, a calm and beautiful way to wrap up this cultural getaway.</p>

                <h3>Day 12 – One Last Look at Porto</h3>
                <p>The day of departure had come. At 11 a.m., we checked out of our rooms, our suitcases packed with memories and our minds full of images. To make the most of our last few hours in Porto, we returned to the Crystal Palace Gardens, a place we had grown particularly fond of.</p>
                <p>We wanted to see the peacocks one last time… and to our surprise, some of them had actually climbed up into the trees, perched like wild exotic birds. It caught us completely off guard and gave us a good laugh — a funny and unexpected farewell from Porto.</p>
                <p>Before saying goodbye to the city, we also stopped by McDonald's for one last meal — a sort of light-hearted ritual to mark the end of the trip. Then, at 3 p.m., it was time to hop on the bus to the airport. Waiting there, the mood turned a bit nostalgic.</p>
                <p>Our flight took off at 7 p.m., and from the airplane window, we were lucky enough to watch the sunset above the clouds — a peaceful and beautiful moment to close out this incredible journey. We landed at 9:40 p.m., and reunited with our families, happy but a little sad that the adventure had come to an end.</p>
