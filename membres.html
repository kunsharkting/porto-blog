            <h3>ASPAR Alexandre</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Alexandre, but you can call me Alex. I’m 18 and I live in Blagnac. I’m a huge fan of technology and IT innovation, that’s why I’m an IPI student. When I have free time, I like playing video games and having time with my friends. Also, I’m a passionate about car and automobile sport.</p>

            <h3>De RESSÉGUIER Maxence</h3>
            <p>My name is Maxence de Rességuier, I was born in Toulouse on July 16, 2006. I am currently 18 years old and I live east of Toulouse, with my father in a small village called Préserville and with my mother in a town named Caraman. I went to Jean Marie Fériol kindergarten and primary school. Then, I continued at François Mitterrand middle school in Caraman, where I met most of the friends I still have today.
            <br/>
            In high school, I did a general second year with the engineering sciences option, then I went into STI2D in my first year. Finally, in my senior year, I chose the SIN option, and I obtained my BAC with honors (fairly good mention).
            <br/>
            It is therefore my academic journey that encouraged me to continue my studies at IPI in order to work in cybersecurity or networks.</p>

            <h3>POISSON Quentin</h3>
            <p>Hi! Let me introduce myself, my name is Quentin Poisson. I'm 19 years old, but I'll be turning 20 by the end of this trip to Porto!
            <br/>
            I'm passionate about video games, especially Rocket League. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, walking, and hiking in the mountains.
            <br/>
            In life, I'm a student at IPI, an IT school. But how did I get here?
            Well, before that, I started by obtaining a general high school diploma with Physics-Chemistry and Engineering Science as my specialized subjects.
            After that, I did two years of Computer Science at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse before realizing that I preferred studies that offered more structure, professionalization, and hands-on projects.</p>
