            <h3>ASPAR Alexandre</h3>
            <h4>Hi, my name is Alexandre, but you can call me Alex. I’m 18 and I live in Blagnac. I’m a huge fan of technology and IT innovation, that’s why I’m an IPI student. When I have free time, I like playing video games and having time with my friends. Also, I’m a passionate about car and automobile sport.</h4>

            <h3>De RESSÉGUIER Maxence</h3>
            <h4>My name is Maxence de Rességuier, I was born in Toulouse on July 16, 2006. I am currently 18 years old and I live east of Toulouse, with my father in a small village called Préserville and with my mother in a town named Caraman. I went to Jean Marie Fériol kindergarten and primary school. Then, I continued at François Mitterrand middle school in Caraman, where I met most of the friends I still have today.

                In high school, I did a general second year with the engineering sciences option, then I went into STI2D in my first year. Finally, in my senior year, I chose the SIN option, and I obtained my BAC with honors (fairly good mention).
                
                It is therefore my academic journey that encouraged me to continue my studies at IPI in order to work in cybersecurity or networks.</h4>

            <h3>POISSON Quentin</h3>
            <h4>Hi! Let me introduce myself, my name is Quentin Poisson. I'm 19 years old, but I'll be turning 20 by the end of this trip to Porto!

                I'm passionate about video games, especially Rocket League. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, walking, and hiking in the mountains.
                
                In life, I'm a student at IPI, an IT school. But how did I get here?
                Well, before that, I started by obtaining a general high school diploma with Physics-Chemistry and Engineering Science as my specialized subjects.
                After that, I did two years of Computer Science at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse before realizing that I preferred studies that offered more structure, professionalization, and hands-on projects.</h4>
