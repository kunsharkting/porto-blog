            <h3>Presentation of the city of Porto :
            <br/>
            <p>Porto is one of the most iconic cities in Portugal. Located in the north of the country, it is crossed by the Douro River and is famous for its rich historical heritage, its Porto wine, and its picturesque landscapes.</p></h3>
            <h3>History : 
            <br/>
            Founded during the Roman era under the name "Portus Cale", Porto played a major role in Portugal’s history, particularly during the Age of Maritime Discoveries. Its historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to emblematic monuments such as the Torre dos Clérigos, the Palácio da Bolsa, and the Sé de Porto, an impressive medieval cathedral.</h3>
            <h3>Architecture : 
            <br/>
            Architecturally, Porto blends Gothic, Baroque, Neoclassical, and contemporary styles harmoniously. The city is renowned for its buildings decorated with "azulejos", blue and white painted ceramic tiles that narrate its history. The Casa da Música, with its bold modern design, perfectly illustrates Porto’s architectural dynamism.</h3>

            <h3>The framework of the trip</h3>
            <h3>Educational framework :
            <br/>
            This school trip is a unique opportunity to discover Portuguese culture while improving our English. Throughout the stay, we will have the chance to interact with locals and practice the language in an immersive environment. </h3>
            <h3>Organization :
            <br/>
            The departure is scheduled for May 12, 2025, and we will return on May 24, 2025. The program includes morning classes with our entire class, which will be conducted in English. Once classes are over, we will have free time, so we will probably go out to visit the city's most popular places, try local dishes, have fun in the streets, party a little, and sleep... because sleep is important.</h3>

            <h3>IT Subject :
            <br/>
            As part of our studies in computer science, we explore essential fields such as development and networking. Among these topics, databases play a central role, as they are at the core of many digital applications and services we use daily. Whether for storing website user data, managing banking transactions, or organizing company data, databases are indispensable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A database allows for the storage and manipulation of large amounts of information in a structured and secure way. There are two main categories: relational databases, which use tables and SQL (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle), and NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB or Firebase), which offer greater flexibility for unstructured data.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In our daily lives, databases are everywhere. When we watch a movie on a streaming platform, a database stores the catalog and recommendations. When we make an online purchase, information about products, customers, and payments is managed by databases. Even on social media, they store profiles, messages, and interactions between users.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                With the rise of Big Data and artificial intelligence, databases are evolving to handle increasingly large volumes while ensuring speed and security. Optimizing their management is a major challenge for businesses and developers. Understanding and mastering these technologies is essential for designing efficient systems that meet today’s digital needs.</h3>
