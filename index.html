                <h3>Trip Overview: An Educational and Cultural Experience in Porto</h3>
                <p>We are students at IPI, a computer science school based in Blagnac, Toulouse. If you'd like to learn more about our campus, just click on Pixel (the panda) in the top-left corner of the page!</p>
                <p>As part of our training, we will be going on a trip to Porto, Portugal. This school trip offers a unique opportunity to immerse ourselves in Portuguese culture while enhancing our English skills. Throughout the stay, students will engage with locals and practice English in real-life situations, making it a truly enriching linguistic and cultural experience.</p>
                <p>The trip is scheduled from May 12 to May 23, 2025. Each morning, students will attend English-language classes alongside their classmates. In the afternoons and evenings, they will have free time to explore Porto, discover its most iconic landmarks, enjoy traditional Portuguese cuisine, and experience the city’s vibrant atmosphere. Of course, there will also be time to relax and rest... because sleep is essential to make the most of the journey.</p>

                <h3>Porto: A Timeless Jewel of Portugal</h3>
                <p>Porto is one of the most beautiful cities in Portugal. Located in the north of the country and crossed by the Douro River, it is also known for its rich historical heritage, its world-famous wine, and its stunning landscapes.</p>
                <p>It was founded by the Romans, who first named it Portus, meaning "port," in the 1st century BC. Porto has played an important role throughout Portuguese history, especially during the Age of Maritime Discoveries. Its historic center, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to iconic landmarks such as the Clérigos Tower, the Palácio da Bolsa, and the Sé do Porto, a large medieval cathedral.</p>
                <p>Porto’s architecture presents a mix of Gothic, Baroque, Neoclassical, and contemporary styles. The city is also known for its traditional azulejos—blue and white ceramic tiles that depict scenes from the past. More modern buildings like the Casa da Música bring a newer, more innovative design. This shows that Porto is evolving both culturally and architecturally. Porto is one of the most beautiful cities in Portugal.

                <h3>Computer Science Focus: The Importance of Databases</h3>
                <p>As part of our computer science studies, we explore key areas such as software development and networking. Among these, databases play a pivotal role, forming the backbone of countless digital services and applications we rely on every day. From storing user data on websites to managing banking transactions or organizing business information, databases are essential to modern computing.</p>
                <p>A database enables the storage and manipulation of large volumes of information in a structured and secure manner. There are two primary categories: relational databases, which use tables and SQL (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle), and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB or Firebase), which offer greater flexibility for managing unstructured data.</p>
                <p>In our daily lives, databases are omnipresent. When streaming a film, a database manages the platform’s catalog and personalized recommendations. When shopping online, databases handle product inventories, customer profiles, and payment details. On social media, they store user profiles, messages, and interactions.</p>
                <p>With the growing impact of Big Data and artificial intelligence, databases continue to evolve to manage ever-larger volumes of information while maintaining speed and security. Optimizing their performance is a critical challenge for businesses and developers alike. Mastering these technologies is essential for building efficient and scalable systems that respond to today’s digital demands.</p>
