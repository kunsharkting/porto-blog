            <h3>Presentation of the city of Porto (history, building styles, etc.).</h3>
            <h3>Presentation of the city of Porto :
            Porto is one of the most iconic cities in Portugal. Located in the north of the country, it is crossed by the Douro River and is famous for its rich historical heritage, its Porto wine, and its picturesque landscapes.</h3>
            <h3>History : 
            Founded during the Roman era under the name "Portus Cale", Porto played a major role in Portugal’s history, particularly during the Age of Maritime Discoveries. Its historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to emblematic monuments such as the Torre dos Clérigos, the Palácio da Bolsa, and the Sé de Porto, an impressive medieval cathedral.</h3>
            <h3>Architecture : 
            Architecturally, Porto blends Gothic, Baroque, Neoclassical, and contemporary styles harmoniously. The city is renowned for its buildings decorated with "azulejos", blue and white painted ceramic tiles that narrate its history. The Casa da Música, with its bold modern design, perfectly illustrates Porto’s architectural dynamism.</h3>
